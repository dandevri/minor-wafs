## Introduction
Hello outsider,

This **Formula 1 Dashboard SPA** shows you the the latest statistics about:
* Driver standings
* Drivers
* Race schedule

The upcoming Formula 1 season (2017) is right around the corner. To give race fanatics and Max Verstappen fans insight in the upcoming season is why I build this app. Through the menu you can navigate to the different sections with every page showing different statistics. You can even sort race drivers by name.


## Terminology:
* Driver: The person that drives the Formula 1 car.
* Constructor: The Team a driver races for. (The constructor maintains the car)
* Grand Prix: A race containing `x`laps of a track. The winner wins the trophy for that Grand Prix.
